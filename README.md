# AKS-Utils

## My personal goals

* Gather All info related with AKS for Azure that I like.

* Describe my learning on Kubernetes and any information useful, that I want to remember or share to others.

* Improve my english (isn't perfect, but I imagine that it's readable!)

Note
Sometimes, I will copy and paste info from sites, like definitions or overviews, and ever I put the origin url from was pasted.

## K8S meaning

I think not too much people knows the meaning of K8S, but it's really simple

``` text
KuberneteS
 12345678   (8 letters skipped)
K    8   S
```

It's was funny and curious for me! so If you listen Kubernetes or K8S it's the same!

## Welcome K8S

> Enjoy with me my learnings on the new world that was open to me
