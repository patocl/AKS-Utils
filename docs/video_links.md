# Some interesting AKS videos

Sometimes we like to watch videos, that explain anythging, I prefer read a book about specific technology, but sometimes it's gracefull can see good videos.

## Videos on Microsoft Azure

I got this links from the Microsoft <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/index/?services=kubernetes-service>, Maybe you could review it.
I did and extract, and just get that I really interested

- **Enterprise security in the era of containers and Kubernetes** <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2019-enterprise-security-in-the-era-of-containers-and-kubernetes/>
  
  With Kubernetes quickly becoming the new application deployment infrastructure, traditional enterprise customers are scrambling to understand the new landscape and revamp their enterprise security checklists and tools to secure their applications. In this session, we will examine the container security landscape, walk you through common pitfalls to avoid, and look at capabilities in and around Azure Kubernetes Service that can help.

- **From dev to production: Container lifecycle, monitoring, logging and troubleshooting** <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2019-from-dev-to-production-container-lifecycle-monitoring-logging-and-troubleshooting/>
  
  As developers push intellectual property to registries, how will you secure and protect that IP? Additionally, how do you ensure that once those applications are deployed they properly running and in good shape? In this session we'll cover building container images, image scanning, signing and promotion across environments. Then we will look at the tools and knowledge you need to keep your containerized applications healthy and how to detect when something goes wrong.

- Preview of Availability Zones for your Kubernetes cluster in Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/index/?services=kubernetes-service>
  
  Justin Luk joins Scott Hanselman to discuss AKS preview features and enabling new functionality like Virtual Machine Scale Set node pools and Availability Zones. Availability Zones (AZ) is a high availability offering from Azure that protects applications and data from datacenter failures. By using AZ with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you will get higher reliability and resiliency for your applications running on Kubernetes.Preview - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that uses Availability ZonesAvailability Zones support is now available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) in previewAzure Kubernetes Service docsWhat are Availability Zones in Azure?Learn more about KubernetesCreate a free account (Azure)

- Service Mesh on AKS, the future is now <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/index/?services=kubernetes-service>
  
  The presentation introduces the journey that we have faced and challenged in adopting widely distributed software systems and Microservices-based architectures in our project. Firstly, we focus on how a full-blown service mesh solution fixes perfectly into our hard use cases in the real world Microservices project. Secondly, we show you how can we resolve interesting challenges such as connect, secure, control and observe services with Istio on the powerful Azure cloud platform with a fully managed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Lastly, we give you a practical understandable demo which puts it all together, to sum up, what we did.

- End to end application development and DevOps on Azure Kubernetes Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2019-end-to-end-application-development-and-devops-on-azure-kubernetes-service/>
  
  By itself, Kubernetes is not necessarily a developer-friendly platform. Building, deploying, and testing microservice-oriented applications involves a lot of manual work and copious amounts of YAML. Thankfully, Azure has the tools you need and makes Kubernetes approachable and productive for developers. In this session, we’ll cover how to design and build microservice applications that can run on the Azure Kubernetes Service, including how to navigate from an app to a container to a Helm package and how to deploy into Kubernetes in a continuous way using Azure DevOps. We’ll also cover how you can use Azure Dev Spaces to develop an app that includes a couple of microservices to one which includes dozens or hundreds.

- Fundamentals of Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure and the road ahead <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2019-fundamentals-of-kubernetes-on-microsoft-azure-and-the-road-ahead/>
  
  Companies of all sizes and industries are embracing containers and Kubernetes to deliver mission-critical applications with greater agility in the development, test, and deployment cycles.  In this session, we will discuss where we are heading with Kubernetes on Azure, share the most common scenarios and best practices derived from real customer use cases, and demo serverless Kubernetes, one of the application patterns that you can achieve through Kubernetes on Azure. Join us if you are starting in the Kubernetes journey and interested to know the frontier of this space!
  
- Serverless Kubernetes, KEDA, and Azure Functions <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2019-serverless-kubernetes-keda-and-azure-functions/>
  
  Learn about the exciting new features for Azure Kubernetes which bring event driven and serverless to Kubernetes. Understand AKS Virtual Nodes and how they can unlock serverless containers, and see KEDA in action which brings event driven scaling to any Kubernetes cluster. We’ll go through building an Azure Function in Visual Studio Code, publishing it to Kubernetes with KEDA, and watching it scale within Kubernetes the same way the function would scale in the Azure Functions service.

- Container DevOps with Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/ignite-2018-container-devops-with-microsoft-azure/>
  
  Learn how to make use of Docker Containers and the Azure Kubernetes Service to scale your applications and learn how to build a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline (CI/CD) all hosted in the cloud with Azure and powered by Azure DevOps.

- **Azure Kubernetes networking 101** <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/ignite-2018-azure-kubernetes-networking-101/>
  
  The hype around containers still outweighs production deployments, but it's time for network and cloud architects to prepare for the unique challenges brought in before starting your deployment! How does Kubernetes communication work? - Container-to-container - Pod-to-pod - Pod-to-service - Service-to-external Should I use Azure CNI plug-in or not? How do I build network security? Join this session for answers, and learn the essentials of how these different overlay and underlay control planes works in an Azure Kubernetes Service context.

- **Machine learning at scale** <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/machine-learning-at-scale/>
  
  AI/ML expert Paige Bailey takes you on a tour of the powerful services available on Azure. You'll see how to take your predictive model to production, dynamically train it online with streaming updates, and add realtime data to your models from IoT sources. Paige covers Azure DataBricks, Batch AI, KubeFlow + AKS, Stream Analytics, and Event Hubs in a session you won't want to miss.

- **Best Practices with Azure & Kubernetes** <https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/resources/videos/build-2018-best-practices-with-azure-kubernetes/>
  
  Azure and Kubernetes go together like peanut butter and jelly with Azure offering many options to host Kubernetes. In this session, we'll show you how to mix the Open Source tools you already use with the powerful Kubernetes hosting options on Azure. Take your deployment and orchestration to the next level!
