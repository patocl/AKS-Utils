# Best Practices for Source Control

* **Make small changes**
In other words, commit early and commit often. Of course, be careful not to commit any unfinished work
that could break the build.

* **Don’t commit personal files**
These could include application settings or SSH keys. Often these are committed accidently but cause problems later down the line
when other team members are working on the same code.

* **Update often and right before pushing to avoid merge conflicts**

* **Verify your code change before pushing it to a repository**
ensure it compiles and tests are passing.

* **Pay close attention to commit messages as these will tell you why a change was made**
Consider commit messages as a mini form of documentation for the change.

* **Link code changes to work items**
This will concretely link what was created to to why it was created or changed by providing traceability across requirements
and code changes.

* **No matter your background or preferences, be a team player and follow agreed conventions and workflows**
Consistency is important and helps ensure quality making it easier for team members to pick up where you left off,
to review your code, to debug, etc.
